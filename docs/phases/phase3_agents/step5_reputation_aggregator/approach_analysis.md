## Technical Implementation Details

### Dynamic Weighting Strategies

#### Context-Aware Weighting
- **Use Case Adaptation:** Different weightings for compliance vs lending vs governance
- **Risk Tolerance Integration:** Adjust weightings based on stakeholder risk appetite
- **Data Quality Influence:** Weight components based on their data quality and confidence
- **Temporal Factors:** Consider how weights should change based on data age and relevance

#### Adaptive Weighting Algorithms
```python
Weighting Strategies:
1. Static Weights: Pre-configured weights for each component
2. Quality-Adjusted: Weights scaled by component confidence scores
3. Context-Driven: Weights determined by business use case requirements
4. Uncertainty-Weighted: Inverse weighting based on uncertainty levels
5. Hybrid Dynamic: Combination of multiple strategies with meta-weighting
```

### Multi-Dimensional Scoring Framework

#### Dimensional Score Definitions
- **Compliance Score:** Focus on regulatory compliance, sanctions screening, AML indicators
- **Credit Risk Score:** Lending-focused assessment of financial behavior and stability
- **Governance Score:** DAO participation quality, voting behavior, community engagement
- **Security Score:** Threat assessment, attack patterns, security risk indicators
- **Innovation Score:** DeFi sophistication, protocol adoption, technical innovation

#### Cross-Dimensional Correlation Analysis
- **Correlation Detection:** Identify relationships between different dimensional scores
- **Consistency Validation:** Ensure dimensional scores are internally consistent
- **Conflict Resolution:** Handle cases where different dimensions suggest conflicting assessments
- **Dimensional Balance:** Maintain balance across different dimensional perspectives

### Uncertainty Quantification System

#### Confidence Interval Calculation
```python
Confidence Calculation Framework:
- Component Confidence: Individual agent confidence scores
- Data Quality Impact: How data quality affects overall confidence
- Cross-Component Correlation: How component dependencies affect uncertainty
- Temporal Uncertainty: How time affects confidence degradation
- Aggregation Uncertainty: Additional uncertainty from aggregation process

Final Confidence Interval = f(
    component_confidences,
    data_quality_scores,
    correlation_matrix,
    temporal_factors,
    aggregation_methodology
)
```

#### Uncertainty Propagation Methods
- **Monte Carlo Simulation:** Sample from component uncertainty distributions
