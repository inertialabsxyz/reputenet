# Phase 1: Foundation Setup - Steps Overview

**Phase Goal:** Establish project infrastructure and basic scaffolding
**Duration:** 1-2 weeks
**Dependencies:** None (starting phase)

---

## Step Overview

### Step 1: Project Structure Setup
**Duration:** 1-2 days
**Objective:** Create proper Python project structure with packaging

**Inputs:**
- Original design specification
- Project breakdown methodology

**Outputs:**
- Complete directory structure following Python best practices
- Initial `pyproject.toml` with basic metadata
- `.env` template for configuration
- Basic README with project overview

**Key Decisions:**
- Package management approach (UV vs pip vs poetry)
- Project structure layout (src/ vs direct package)
- Testing framework choice

---

### Step 2: Dependency Management
**Duration:** 1-2 days
**Objective:** Install and configure all required dependencies

**Inputs:**
- Dependency list from specification
- Project structure from Step 1

**Outputs:**
- Complete `pyproject.toml` with all dependencies
- Virtual environment setup
- Dependency resolution verification
- Lock file for reproducible builds

**Key Decisions:**
- LangChain vs LangGraph version compatibility
- OpenAI vs other LLM provider choice
- Web3 library version for Ethereum compatibility

---

### Step 3: Configuration System
**Duration:** 1-2 days
**Objective:** Implement environment-based configuration management

**Inputs:**
- Environment variables from specification
- Dependency injection requirements

**Outputs:**
- Configuration schema with Pydantic models
- Environment variable loading system
- Configuration validation
- Development vs production config separation

**Key Decisions:**
- Configuration library choice (python-dotenv vs dynaconf)
- Secret management approach
- Environment-specific overrides

---

### Step 4: Basic Project Infrastructure
**Duration:** 2-3 days
**Objective:** Set up development tooling and basic documentation

**Inputs:**
- Complete project structure
- All dependencies installed
- Configuration system working

**Outputs:**
- Code formatting and linting setup (black, ruff)
- Pre-commit hooks configuration
- Basic test structure with pytest
- CI/CD pipeline foundation
- Developer setup documentation

**Key Decisions:**
- Code style enforcement level
- Pre-commit hook strictness
- CI/CD platform choice (GitHub Actions vs other)

---

## Success Criteria

**Phase 1 is complete when:**

1. **Clean Setup** - New developers can clone and set up the project in < 15 minutes
2. **Dependency Resolution** - All required packages install without conflicts
3. **Configuration Works** - Environment variables load and validate properly
4. **Basic Tests Pass** - Project structure tests and configuration tests pass
5. **Documentation Current** - README and setup docs are accurate and complete

---

## Risk Areas

### Technical Risks
- **Dependency Conflicts** - LangChain ecosystem changes rapidly
- **Python Version Compatibility** - Ensuring compatibility across development environments
- **Environment Setup Complexity** - Too many steps for new developers

### Mitigation Strategies
- Pin specific dependency versions in lock file
- Test setup process on clean environments
- Automate as much setup as possible with scripts
- Document troubleshooting for common issues

## Phase 1 Dependencies

```
Step 1 (Project Structure)
    ↓
Step 2 (Dependencies)
    ↓
Step 3 (Configuration)
    ↓
Step 4 (Infrastructure)
```

**Critical Path:** Steps must be completed in order as each builds on the previous. Step 2 is highest risk due to potential dependency conflicts.

## Acceptance Checklist

- [ ] Project can be cloned and set up by new developer
- [ ] All dependencies install successfully
- [ ] Configuration loads from environment variables
- [ ] Basic tests pass
- [ ] Code formatting and linting work
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks function properly

---

## Next Actions

After Phase 1 completion:
1. **Validate setup** with fresh environment test
2. **Create Phase 2 step breakdown** for infrastructure components
3. **Begin schema design** for data models
4. **Research external API requirements** for tool adapters
