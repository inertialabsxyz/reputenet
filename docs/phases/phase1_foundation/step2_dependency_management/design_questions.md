# Step 2: Dependency Management - Design Questions

**Context:** Setting up dependencies for mock-first prototype with no API keys
**Decision Point:** Choosing dependency strategy that supports rapid prototype development

---

## Critical Design Questions

### 1. Package Manager Choice
**Question:** Should we use UV, pip, poetry, or another package manager?

**Context from Decisions:**
- Original spec suggests UV
- Prototype focus requires rapid iteration
- Single developer workflow
- No complex dependency conflicts expected

**Options:**
- **UV** ⭐ - Fast, modern, explicitly mentioned in spec
- **Poetry** - Popular with lock files, more complex setup
- **pip + requirements.txt** - Simple but less sophisticated
- **pip-tools** - Middle ground with compilation

**Decision Needed:** Which provides best developer experience for prototype?

### 2. Version Pinning Strategy
**Question:** How strict should version pinning be?

**Options:**
- **Strict Pinning** - Pin exact versions for maximum reproducibility
- **Range Pinning** ⭐ - Pin major versions, allow minor updates
- **Loose Pinning** - Minimal constraints, latest versions

**Context:** Prototype needs stability but also security updates

**Decision Needed:** Balance between stability and security updates?

### 3. Development Dependencies
**Question:** How comprehensive should development tooling be?

**Options:**
- **Minimal** - Just testing and basic linting
- **Standard** ⭐ - Testing, linting, formatting, pre-commit
- **Comprehensive** - All tools plus documentation, security scanning

**Context:** Single developer, prototype timeline, future extensibility

**Decision Needed:** Level of development infrastructure investment?

### 4. Mock vs Real Dependency Handling
**Question:** How should we handle dependencies that will eventually use real APIs?

**Options:**
- **Mock-Only Dependencies** - Only include what's needed for mocking
- **Real Dependencies Included** ⭐ - Include real API libraries but use mock mode
- **Conditional Dependencies** - Different dependency sets for mock vs real

**Context:** No API keys available, but clean future migration path needed

**Decision Needed:** Approach that best supports mock-to-real transition?

## Secondary Design Questions

### 5. Optional Dependencies
**Question:** How should optional features be handled?

**Options:**
- **All Included** - Include all potential dependencies
- **Optional Groups** ⭐ - Use optional dependency groups
- **Separate Requirements** - Different requirements files

### 6. Performance Dependencies
**Question:** Should we include performance optimization libraries?

**Options:**
- **Include Early** - Add performance libraries from start
- **Add Later** ⭐ - Focus on functionality first
- **Conditional** - Only if performance issues arise

## Recommended Decisions

### ✅ High Confidence Recommendations

1. **UV Package Manager** ⭐
   - **Rationale:** Specified in original spec, fast, modern
   - **Implementation:** Use UV with pyproject.toml

2. **Range Pinning Strategy** ⭐
   - **Rationale:** Stability with security updates
   - **Implementation:** Pin major versions, allow minor updates

3. **Standard Development Tooling** ⭐
   - **Rationale:** Good developer experience without over-engineering
   - **Implementation:** Black, ruff, pytest, pre-commit, mypy

4. **Real Dependencies with Mock Mode** ⭐
   - **Rationale:** Clean migration path to real APIs
   - **Implementation:** Include real libraries, use mock flags

## Impact on Implementation

### Dependency Categories
**Core Runtime:**
- LangChain/LangGraph ecosystem
- Data handling (Pydantic, pandas)
- Web framework (FastAPI)

**External APIs (Mock Mode):**
- Web3.py for Ethereum (mock mode)
- HTTP libraries for API simulation
- Blockchain data libraries

**Development:**
- Testing framework and tools
- Code quality and formatting
- Pre-commit hooks and validation

**Optional:**
- Performance optimization
- Advanced analytics
- Visualization tools

## Next Steps

1. **Confirm package manager choice** - UV recommended
2. **Define dependency groups** in pyproject.toml
3. **Set up mock vs real API strategy**
4. **Implement dependency installation and validation**
