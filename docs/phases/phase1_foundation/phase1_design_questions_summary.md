# Phase 1: Foundation Setup - Design Questions Summary

**Status:** REQUIRES DECISIONS BEFORE PROCEEDING
**Impact:** These decisions affect all subsequent development phases

---

## Critical Design Questions Requiring Immediate Resolution

### 1. Package Management Strategy
**Question:** Should we use UV, pip, poetry, or another package manager?

**Options:**
- **UV** ⭐ (Recommended) - Fast, modern Python package installer
- **Poetry** - Popular dependency management with lock files
- **pip + requirements.txt** - Simple, universally compatible
- **pip-tools** - Compile requirements with dependency resolution

**Spec Context:** Original spec suggests `uv pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Decision Needed:** Which approach for dependency management?

---

### 2. Module Organization Strategy
**Question:** How should we organize the agents and tools modules?

**Options:**
- **Flat structure** ⭐ (Recommended) - All agents in single `agents/` directory
- **Hierarchical** - Group by functionality (e.g., `agents/analysis/`, `agents/data/`)
- **Feature-based** - Group by business domain (e.g., `risk/`, `sybil/`, `data/`)

**Spec Context:** 6 distinct agents + multiple tool adapters mentioned

**Decision Needed:** Module organization granularity?

---

### 3. Configuration Architecture
**Question:** How should configuration and secrets be managed?

**Options:**
- **Simple .env** ⭐ (Recommended) - Single environment file with python-dotenv
- **Hierarchical config** - Environment-specific configuration files
- **External config** - Configuration from environment/cloud config services
- **Mixed approach** - Local .env for development, external for production

**Spec Context:** Multiple API keys required (RPC, Etherscan, Alchemy, OpenAI)

**Decision Needed:**
- How should secrets be handled in different environments?
- Should configuration be validated at startup?
- Environment-specific override complexity?

---

### 4. Testing Strategy Foundation
**Question:** What testing architecture should we establish?

**Options:**
- **Comprehensive fixtures** ⭐ (Recommended) - Rich test data and mock objects
- **Simple pytest** - Basic unit testing with minimal fixtures
- **Integration-focused** - Emphasis on end-to-end testing
- **TDD approach** - Test-first development methodology

**Spec Context:** Unit tests per agent + integration tests + golden cases mentioned

**Decision Needed:**
- How much test infrastructure upfront?
- Mock external APIs or test against real data?
- Balance between unit and integration tests?

---

### 5. CLI and Execution Interface
**Question:** How should users interact with the ReputeNet system?

**Options:**
- **CLI script** ⭐ (Recommended) - `reputenet` command via entry points
- **Module execution** - `python -m reputenet`
- **API server** - HTTP API for programmatic access
- **Multiple interfaces** - CLI, API, and library usage

**Spec Context:** Shows `python -m src.graph` execution

**Decision Needed:** Primary usage pattern and interface priority?

---

## Secondary Design Questions

### 6. Error Handling Strategy
**Question:** How should errors and retries be handled across the system?

**Considerations:**
- External API failures and rate limiting
- Blockchain data inconsistencies
- LLM API timeouts and errors
- Spec mentions "idempotent retries at each node"

### 7. Logging and Observability
**Question:** What level of logging and monitoring should be built in?

**Spec Context:** Structured logging with structlog + duration tracking per node mentioned

### 8. Extensibility Architecture
**Question:** How should the system be designed for future extensions?

**Spec Context:** Extension ideas include multi-chain, entity aggregation, ZK proofs

---

## Recommended Decisions (High Confidence)

Based on the spec and best practices:

1. **✅ Package Management: UV** - Specified in original spec, fast and modern
2. **✅ Project Structure: src/ layout** - Industry standard, better testing isolation
3. **✅ Configuration: Simple .env with validation** - Balances simplicity with safety
4. **✅ Module Organization: Flat structure** - Simple for 6 agents, can evolve later
5. **✅ CLI: Entry point script** - More discoverable than module execution

## Decisions Requiring Stakeholder Input

### Critical (Must decide now):
- **Testing mock strategy** - Real API calls vs mocked responses for development
- **Configuration complexity** - How much environment-specific override needed?
- **Interface priority** - CLI-first vs library-first design?

### Important (Can defer slightly):
- **Error handling granularity** - Retry policies and failure modes
- **Logging detail level** - Performance vs observability tradeoffs
- **Extension architecture** - How much future-proofing to build in

---

## Blocking Questions for Immediate Resolution

### 1. Testing Data Strategy
**CRITICAL:** Do we have access to test Ethereum addresses and API quotas for development?

**Options:**
- Use mainnet with rate-limited APIs (requires real keys)
- Use testnet data (may not have realistic patterns)
- Mock all external calls (faster but less realistic)
- Hybrid approach (mock for unit tests, real for integration)

**Impact:** Affects Step 2 (dependencies) and Step 4 (test infrastructure)

### 2. Deployment Target
**IMPORTANT:** What's the expected production deployment model?

**Options:**
- Local CLI tool (simple configuration)
- Container deployment (Docker considerations)
- Cloud function/serverless (different configuration needs)
- API service (authentication and scaling considerations)

**Impact:** Affects configuration architecture and dependency choices

### 3. Development Team Size
**CONTEXT:** How many developers will work on this simultaneously?

**Impact:**
- Affects code organization complexity
- Influences testing strategy (shared test data)
- Determines pre-commit hook strictness

## Next Steps

1. **Address Critical Questions** - Get stakeholder input on testing, deployment, team size
2. **Document Final Decisions** - Update implementation notes with confirmed choices
3. **Update Methodology** - Add emphasis on resolving design questions before proceeding
4. **Proceed with Phase 1 Implementation** - Begin Step 2 (Dependencies) with confirmed decisions

**⚠️ PHASE 1 CANNOT PROCEED WITHOUT RESOLVING CRITICAL QUESTIONS ABOVE**
