# Phase 1: Foundation Setup - Final Decisions

**Date:** 2025-10-29
**Decision Authority:** Project Stakeholder
**Context:** Prototype deployed service, single developer, no API keys available

---

## Confirmed Decisions

### 1. Package Management: UV ✅
**Decision:** Use UV for dependency management
**Rationale:**
- Specified in original spec
- Fast and modern
- Good for single developer workflow

### 2. Project Structure: src/ Layout ✅
**Decision:** Use src/reputenet/ structure with flat module organization
**Rationale:**
- Industry standard
- Clean separation of source code
- Scales well for prototype that may grow

### 3. Configuration: Simple .env with Validation ✅
**Decision:** Single .env file with Pydantic validation
**Rationale:**
- Simple for prototype
- Type-safe configuration
- Easy to extend for deployment

### 4. Testing Strategy: Mock-First Approach ✅
**Decision:** Mock all external APIs, provide real API integration as optional
**Rationale:**
- **No API keys available** - Must mock external calls
- Faster development iteration
- Can add real API integration later when keys are available
- Prototype focus - prioritize functionality over real data

### 5. CLI Interface: Entry Point Script ✅
**Decision:** `reputenet` command via setuptools entry points
**Rationale:**
- More discoverable than module execution
- Professional interface for deployed service
- Easy to extend with subcommands

### 6. Deployment Target: Container-Ready Service ✅
**Decision:** Design for containerized deployment from start
**Rationale:**
- Target is deployed service
- Container deployment is standard for services
- Prototype should demonstrate production readiness

### 7. Error Handling: Simple but Robust ✅
**Decision:** Basic retry logic with exponential backoff, comprehensive logging
**Rationale:**
- Prototype needs to be reliable enough to demo
- Single developer - keep complexity manageable
- Good logging helps with debugging

### 8. Logging: Structured with JSON Output ✅
**Decision:** structlog with JSON formatter for service deployment
**Rationale:**
- Service deployment needs structured logs
- JSON logs work well with container orchestration
- Debugging aid for single developer

## Prototype-Specific Adaptations

### Mock Data Strategy
**Challenge:** No external API access
**Solution:**
- Create realistic mock data for all external APIs
- Use actual Ethereum address formats and transaction patterns
- Base mocks on publicly available data examples
- Design clean interfaces so real APIs can be swapped in later

### Development Workflow
**Approach:**
- Local development with mocked APIs
- Docker container for testing deployment
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
- Documentation for adding real API keys later

### Scope Prioritization
**Focus Areas (MVP):**
1. Complete agent pipeline with mocked data
2. Proper JSON schema output
3. Basic web interface or API endpoint
4. Container deployment working

**Deferred:**
- Real blockchain data integration
- Performance optimization
- Advanced error handling
- Multi-chain support

## Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1 (Foundation) - Critical
- ✅ Project structure and dependencies
- ✅ Mock data infrastructure
- ✅ Basic configuration management
- ✅ Container deployment setup

### Phase 2 (Infrastructure) - Critical
- LangGraph orchestration with mock nodes
- Typed data schemas matching spec
- Mock tool adapters with realistic responses
- Basic dependency injection

### Phase 3 (Agents) - Critical
- All 6 agents implemented with mock data
- Reputation scoring algorithms working
- JSON output matching spec
- Basic web interface

### Phase 4 (Polish) - Important
- Complete test suite with mocked APIs
- Container deployment documentation
- Performance testing with mock data
- Documentation for real API integration

---

## Technical Constraints

### No External APIs
**Impact:** All external data must be mocked
**Mitigation:**
- Create comprehensive mock datasets
- Use realistic Ethereum data patterns
- Design clean abstraction layer for future real API integration

### Single Developer
**Impact:** Limited parallel development, simpler architecture preferred
**Mitigation:**
- Prioritize working software over perfect architecture
- Use proven patterns and libraries
- Focus on clear, readable code

### Prototype Timeline
**Impact:** Favor speed over optimization
**Mitigation:**
- Use high-level libraries (LangChain/LangGraph)
- Minimize custom implementations
- Accept technical debt for later resolution

## Success Criteria (Updated for Prototype)

### Phase 1 Complete When:
1. ✅ Project structure supports containerized deployment
2. ✅ All dependencies install correctly with UV
3. ✅ Mock data infrastructure is established
4. ✅ Basic configuration works with environment variables
5. ✅ Docker container builds and runs

### Overall Prototype Success:
1. **Functional Demo** - Complete reputation analysis with mocked data
2. **Proper Output** - JSON schema matches specification
3. **Service Interface** - Can be called via HTTP API or CLI
4. **Deployable** - Runs in container with documented setup
5. **Extensible** - Clear path to add real API integration

---

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Phase 1 documentation** with mock-focused approach
2. **Create Phase 1 runbook** with Docker setup
3. **Begin implementation** starting with project structure
4. **Establish mock data patterns** early in Phase 2

**Key Principle:** Build a working prototype that demonstrates the full ReputeNet concept using realistic mock data, with clean interfaces for future real API integration.
