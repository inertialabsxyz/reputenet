# Step 4: LangGraph Orchestration Framework - Design Questions

**Context:** LangGraph-based agent workflow orchestration for 6-agent pipeline
**Decision Point:** LangGraph architecture that supports complex agent coordination with error handling

---

## Critical Design Questions

### 1. Graph Architecture Complexity
**Question:** How complex should the LangGraph workflow structure be?

**Options:**
- **Linear Pipeline** - Simple sequential execution: DataHarvester → Profiler → RiskScorer → Sybil → Aggregator → Reporter
- **Parallel Branches** ⭐ - Parallel execution where possible: Profiler branches to RiskScorer + SybilDetector in parallel
- **Conditional Routing** - Dynamic routing based on analysis results and error conditions
- **Hierarchical Graphs** - Sub-graphs for complex agent workflows

**Context:** 6 agents with dependencies, need to optimize execution time while maintaining reliability

**Decision Needed:** Graph complexity that balances performance with maintainability?

### 2. State Management Strategy
**Question:** How should state be managed and passed between agents?

**Options:**
- **Centralized State** ⭐ - Single GraphState object passed through all nodes
- **Distributed State** - Each agent maintains its own state portion
- **Immutable State** - State is never modified, only new state objects created
- **Hybrid Approach** - Core state centralized, agent-specific state distributed

**Context:** Complex data flows between agents, need type safety and debugging capability

**Decision Needed:** State management approach that ensures data consistency and debugging visibility?

### 3. Error Handling and Recovery Strategy
**Question:** How should the workflow handle agent failures and errors?

**Options:**
- **Fail Fast** - Stop entire workflow on first agent failure
- **Graceful Degradation** ⭐ - Continue with reduced functionality when possible
- **Retry with Backoff** - Automatic retry of failed agents with exponential backoff
- **Human-in-the-Loop** - Pause for manual intervention on failures

**Context:** External APIs may fail, need robust error handling for production readiness

**Decision Needed:** Error handling strategy that maximizes workflow completion while maintaining data quality?

### 4. Agent Execution Parallelization
**Question:** Which agents can execute in parallel to optimize performance?

**Options:**
- **Full Sequential** - All agents execute one after another
- **Risk/Sybil Parallel** ⭐ - RiskScorer and SybilDetector execute in parallel after AddressProfiler
- **Maximum Parallelization** - All independent agents execute in parallel
- **Dynamic Parallelization** - Determine parallelization based on data dependencies

**Context:** Some agents have data dependencies, others can execute independently

**Decision Needed:** Parallelization strategy that optimizes execution time while respecting dependencies?

---

## Secondary Design Questions

### 5. Workflow Checkpointing Strategy
**Question:** How should workflow progress be checkpointed for recovery?

**Options:**
- **Agent-Level Checkpoints** ⭐ - Save state after each agent completion
- **No Checkpointing** - Run entire workflow from start on failure
- **Custom Checkpoints** - Checkpoint at critical decision points
- **Continuous Checkpointing** - Save state continuously during execution

### 6. Workflow Timeout and Resource Management
**Question:** How should timeouts and resource limits be managed?

**Options:**
- **Global Timeout** ⭐ - Single timeout for entire workflow
- **Per-Agent Timeouts** - Individual timeouts for each agent
- **Adaptive Timeouts** - Timeouts based on data size and complexity
- **No Timeouts** - Let workflows run indefinitely

### 7. Node Execution Monitoring
**Question:** How detailed should execution monitoring and logging be?

**Options:**
- **Comprehensive Monitoring** ⭐ - Track all execution metrics and state changes
- **Basic Logging** - Simple start/stop logging for each agent
- **Error-Only Logging** - Only log when errors occur
- **No Monitoring** - Skip monitoring for prototype simplicity

## Recommended Decisions

### ✅ High Confidence Recommendations

1. **Parallel Branches Architecture** ⭐
   - **Rationale:** Optimize execution time while maintaining dependency order
   - **Implementation:** Sequential DataHarvester → AddressProfiler, then parallel RiskScorer + SybilDetector → ReputationAggregator → Reporter

2. **Centralized State with Typed Interfaces** ⭐
   - **Rationale:** Clear data flow visibility and type safety
   - **Implementation:** Single GraphState with agent-specific state sections

3. **Graceful Degradation with Retry Logic** ⭐
   - **Rationale:** Maximize workflow completion while maintaining quality
   - **Implementation:** Continue workflow with partial results, retry transient failures

4. **Agent-Level Checkpointing** ⭐
   - **Rationale:** Enable workflow recovery without full restart
   - **Implementation:** Save state after each successful agent execution

## Impact on Implementation

### Graph Structure
```python
# LangGraph workflow definition
workflow = StateGraph(ReputeNetGraphState)

# Add nodes
workflow.add_node("data_harvester", data_harvester_agent)
workflow.add_node("address_profiler", address_profiler_agent)
workflow.add_node("risk_scorer", risk_scorer_agent)
workflow.add_node("sybil_detector", sybil_detector_agent)
workflow.add_node("reputation_aggregator", reputation_aggregator_agent)
workflow.add_node("reporter", reporter_agent)

# Define edges (dependencies)
workflow.add_edge(START, "data_harvester")
workflow.add_edge("data_harvester", "address_profiler")

# Parallel execution after address profiler
workflow.add_edge("address_profiler", "risk_scorer")
workflow.add_edge("address_profiler", "sybil_detector")

# Convergence at reputation aggregator
workflow.add_edge("risk_scorer", "reputation_aggregator")
workflow.add_edge("sybil_detector", "reputation_aggregator")

# Final reporting
workflow.add_edge("reputation_aggregator", "reporter")
workflow.add_edge("reporter", END)
```

### Error Handling Strategy
```python
class WorkflowErrorHandler:
    def __init__(self, max_retries: int = 3, graceful_degradation: bool = True):
        self.max_retries = max_retries
        self.graceful_degradation = graceful_degradation

    async def handle_agent_error(
        self,
        agent_name: str,
        error: Exception,
        state: ReputeNetGraphState
    ) -> ReputeNetGraphState:
        """Handle agent execution errors."""

        # Log error
        error_info = WorkflowError(
            agent_name=agent_name,
            error_type=type(error).__name__,
            error_message=str(error),
            recoverable=self._is_recoverable_error(error)
        )

        state.errors.append(error_info)

        # Attempt retry for recoverable errors
        if error_info.recoverable and state.retry_attempts < self.max_retries:
            state.retry_attempts += 1
            return state  # Retry the agent

        # Graceful degradation
        if self.graceful_degradation:
            return self._apply_graceful_degradation(agent_name, state)

        # Fail the workflow
        state.fail_workflow(error_info)
        return state

    def _apply_graceful_degradation(
        self,
        failed_agent: str,
        state: ReputeNetGraphState
    ) -> ReputeNetGraphState:
        """Apply graceful degradation strategies."""

        if failed_agent == "risk_scorer":
            # Continue without risk scoring
            state.risk_scorer.status = AgentStatus.SKIPPED
            return state

        elif failed_agent == "sybil_detector":
            # Continue without sybil detection
            state.sybil_detector.status = AgentStatus.SKIPPED
            return state

        # For critical agents, fail the workflow
        else:
            error = WorkflowError(
                agent_name=failed_agent,
                error_type="CriticalAgentFailure",
                error_message=f"Critical agent {failed_agent} failed"
            )
            state.fail_workflow(error)
            return state
```

### Checkpointing Implementation
```python
class WorkflowCheckpointer:
    def __init__(self, storage_backend: str = "memory"):
        self.storage = self._create_storage(storage_backend)

    async def save_checkpoint(
        self,
        workflow_id: str,
        state: ReputeNetGraphState,
        agent_name: str
    ) -> None:
        """Save workflow checkpoint after agent completion."""

        checkpoint_data = {
            "workflow_id": workflow_id,
            "agent_name": agent_name,
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
            "state": state.dict(),
            "completed_agents": self._get_completed_agents(state)
        }

        await self.storage.save(f"checkpoint_{workflow_id}", checkpoint_data)

    async def restore_checkpoint(
        self,
        workflow_id: str
    ) -> Optional[ReputeNetGraphState]:
        """Restore workflow from last checkpoint."""

        checkpoint_data = await self.storage.load(f"checkpoint_{workflow_id}")
        if not checkpoint_data:
            return None

        # Restore state
        state_dict = checkpoint_data["state"]
        return ReputeNetGraphState(**state_dict)

    def _get_completed_agents(self, state: ReputeNetGraphState) -> List[str]:
        """Get list of completed agents."""
        completed = []
        agent_states = {
            "data_harvester": state.data_harvester,
            "address_profiler": state.address_profiler,
            "risk_scorer": state.risk_scorer,
            "sybil_detector": state.sybil_detector,
            "reputation_aggregator": state.reputation_aggregator,
            "reporter": state.reporter
        }

        for agent_name, agent_state in agent_states.items():
            if agent_state.status == AgentStatus.COMPLETED:
                completed.append(agent_name)

        return completed
```
