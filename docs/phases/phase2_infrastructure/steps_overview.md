# Phase 2: Core Infrastructure - Steps Overview

**Phase Goal:** Implement foundational components for data handling and orchestration
**Duration:** 2-3 days
**Dependencies:** Phase 1 (Foundation Setup) complete
**Context:** Mock-first prototype, deployed service, single developer

---

## Step Overview

### Step 1: Mock Data Generation System
**Duration:** 4-6 hours
**Objective:** Create realistic blockchain mock data that simulates real Ethereum patterns

**Inputs:**
- Phase 1 project structure
- Real blockchain data patterns research
- Faker and factory-boy libraries

**Outputs:**
- Mock transaction generators
- Mock address relationship data
- Mock protocol interaction patterns
- Realistic ERC-20/NFT mock data
- Mock data validation and testing

**Key Decisions:**
- Mock data realism vs generation speed
- Data persistence strategy (files vs in-memory)
- Mock data volume for testing different scenarios

---

### Step 2: Data Schemas and State Management
**Duration:** 3-4 hours
**Objective:** Implement typed data models and LangGraph state management

**Inputs:**
- Original ReputeNet specification schemas
- LangGraph StateGraph requirements
- Mock data structures from Step 1

**Outputs:**
- Complete Pydantic models for all data flows
- LangGraph GraphState implementation
- Type validation and serialization
- State transition validation
- Schema documentation

**Key Decisions:**
- State immutability vs performance tradeoffs
- Validation strictness level
- Backward compatibility considerations

---

### Step 3: Tool Adapters with Mock Implementation
**Duration:** 4-5 hours
**Objective:** Build external API tool adapters with comprehensive mock backends

**Inputs:**
- Tool interface requirements from spec
- Mock data from Step 1
- External API documentation research

**Outputs:**
- EthProviderTool with mock Ethereum RPC responses
- EtherscanTool with mock transaction history
- DefiLlamaTool with mock protocol metadata
- LabelRegistry with mock address classifications
- Rate limiting and caching infrastructure
- Clean interfaces for future real API integration

**Key Decisions:**
- Mock response fidelity level
- Caching strategy for mock responses
- Error simulation approach

---

### Step 4: LangGraph Orchestration Framework
**Duration:** 3-4 hours
**Objective:** Implement the complete agent workflow using LangGraph

**Inputs:**
- Agent workflow from specification
- Data schemas from Step 2
- Tool adapters from Step 3

**Outputs:**
- Complete StateGraph with all 6 nodes
- Node execution logic with mock implementations
- State transitions and error handling
- Graph compilation and execution testing
- Retry and resume functionality

**Key Decisions:**
- Node granularity and responsibilities
- Error handling and retry strategies
- State persistence requirements

---

### Step 5: Dependency Injection and Service Layer
**Duration:** 2-3 hours
**Objective:** Create clean dependency injection for swappable components

**Inputs:**
- Tool adapters from Step 3
- Configuration system from Phase 1
- Service architecture requirements

**Outputs:**
- Dependency injection container
- Service factory patterns
- Configuration-driven component selection
- Mock vs real API switching logic
- Service lifecycle management

**Key Decisions:**
- DI framework choice (custom vs library)
- Service instantiation patterns
- Configuration override mechanisms

---

## Success Criteria

**Phase 2 is complete when:**

1. **Mock Data Realistic** - Generated mock data resembles real blockchain patterns
2. **State Management Works** - LangGraph state flows through all nodes correctly
3. **Tool Adapters Functional** - All external API calls return realistic mock responses
4. **Graph Execution** - Complete pipeline runs end-to-end with mock data
5. **Type Safety** - All data flows are properly typed and validated
6. **Dependency Injection** - Services can be configured and swapped cleanly
7. **Error Handling** - System gracefully handles errors and retries

---

## Risk Areas

### Technical Risks
- **Mock Data Quality** - Unrealistic mock data could hide real-world issues
- **LangGraph Complexity** - Learning curve for LangGraph orchestration
- **State Management Performance** - Large state objects may impact performance
- **Type Safety Overhead** - Extensive validation may slow development

### Mitigation Strategies
- Research real blockchain data patterns extensively
- Start with simple LangGraph flows, add complexity incrementally
- Profile state management early, optimize if needed
- Balance type safety with development speed

## Phase 2 Dependencies

```
Step 1 (Mock Data)
    ↓
Step 2 (Schemas) ← depends on mock data structures
    ↓
Step 3 (Tools) ← depends on schemas and mock data
    ↓
Step 4 (LangGraph) ← depends on tools and schemas
    ↓
Step 5 (DI) ← integrates all components
```

**Critical Path:** Mock data generation is foundational - all other steps depend on realistic test data.

## Integration Points

### With Phase 1
- Uses project structure and configuration from Phase 1
- Extends CLI and API interfaces with real functionality
- Builds on testing infrastructure

### With Phase 3 (Agents)
- Provides data schemas for agent implementations
- Offers tool adapters for agent external calls
- Supplies orchestration framework for agent execution
