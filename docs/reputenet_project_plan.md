# ReputeNet Project Plan

**Project:** Multi-Agent System for On-Chain Reputation
**Based on:** `repute_net_lang_chain_spec_on_chain_reputation_prototype.md`
**Date:** 2025-10-29
**Methodology:** [Project Breakdown Methodology](./project_breakdown_methodology.md)

---

## Project Overview

ReputeNet is a sophisticated multi-agent system using LangChain/LangGraph to compute on-chain reputation profiles for wallet addresses. The system fetches blockchain data, applies heuristics for risk and sybil detection, and produces structured JSON reports with human-readable summaries.

### Success Criteria (from spec)
- End-to-end run completes under 90s for single address with cached data
- Deterministic orchestration with idempotent retries at each node
- Clear boundaries between data, reasoning, and scoring modules
- Produces both JSON reputation object and Markdown summary

---

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
**Duration:** 1-2 weeks
**Goal:** Establish project infrastructure and basic scaffolding

**Deliverables:**
- Complete Python project structure with proper packaging
- All dependencies installed and configured
- Environment management and configuration system
- Basic project documentation and setup instructions

**Success Criteria:**
- Project can be cloned and set up by new developers
- All dependencies resolve without conflicts
- Configuration system works with environment variables
- Basic health checks pass

---

### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure
**Duration:** 2-3 weeks
**Goal:** Implement foundational components for data handling and orchestration

**Deliverables:**
- Typed data schemas and state management
- External API tool adapters with rate limiting and caching
- LangGraph orchestration framework with all nodes
- Basic dependency injection system

**Success Criteria:**
- All data flows through typed schemas without errors
- External API tools can fetch real blockchain data
- LangGraph can execute full pipeline with mock data
- Caching reduces API calls on subsequent runs

---

### Phase 3: Agent Implementation
**Duration:** 3-4 weeks
**Goal:** Build all six agents with their core business logic

**Deliverables:**
- DataHarvester agent with blockchain data normalization
- AddressProfiler agent with feature extraction
- RiskScorer agent with heuristic-based risk assessment
- SybilDetector agent with graph analysis
- ReputationAggregator agent with weighted scoring
- Reporter agent with JSON and Markdown output

**Success Criteria:**
- Each agent produces valid outputs for test addresses
- Risk and sybil heuristics work with real data patterns
- Reputation scores are consistent and explainable
- Output matches specified JSON schema

---

### Phase 4: Production Readiness
**Duration:** 1-2 weeks
**Goal:** Polish system for production use with monitoring and testing

**Deliverables:**
- Comprehensive test suite with unit and integration tests
- Performance optimization and caching improvements
- Structured logging and monitoring
- Production documentation and deployment guide

**Success Criteria:**
- Test suite covers all critical paths and edge cases
- System meets 90-second performance target
- Logging provides visibility into system behavior
- Documentation enables production deployment

## Phase Dependencies

```
Phase 1 (Foundation)
    ↓
Phase 2 (Infrastructure)
    ↓
Phase 3 (Agents) ← Core development phase
    ↓
Phase 4 (Production)
```

**Critical Path:** The agents in Phase 3 represent the core value of the system and require the infrastructure from Phase 2. Phases 1 and 4 are essential but not differentiating.

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **External API Dependencies** - Etherscan/Alchemy rate limits and reliability
- **Heuristic Effectiveness** - Risk and sybil detection may need tuning with real data
- **Performance Target** - 90-second requirement may be challenging with cold cache

### Medium Risk
- **LangGraph Learning Curve** - Team familiarity with LangChain/LangGraph
- **Data Quality** - Blockchain data inconsistencies and edge cases
- **Reputation Score Calibration** - Balancing different component weights

### Mitigation Strategies
- Build robust retry and fallback mechanisms for external APIs
- Start with simple heuristics and iterate based on real data
- Implement aggressive caching and consider pre-computation for common addresses
- Allocate extra time in Phase 3 for heuristic tuning

---

## Technology Stack

### Core Framework
- **LangChain/LangGraph** - Agent orchestration and workflow management
- **Python 3.9+** - Primary development language

---

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- **1-2 Python developers** with blockchain experience
- **1 DevOps engineer** for deployment and monitoring (Phase 4)

### External Dependencies
- **Ethereum RPC endpoint** (Alchemy/Infura)
- **Etherscan API key**
- **OpenAI API key** for LLM components
- **Optional:** DefiLlama API access

### Compute Resources

## Next Steps

1. **Proceed to Phase 1 detailed breakdown** - Create step-by-step implementation plan
2. **Clarify design questions** - Address ambiguities in original specification
3. **Set up development environment** - Prepare tooling and repositories
4. **Begin Foundation implementation** - Start with project structure and dependencies

This plan provides the roadmap for implementing ReputeNet according to the specification while maintaining flexibility for adjustments based on real-world development experience.
